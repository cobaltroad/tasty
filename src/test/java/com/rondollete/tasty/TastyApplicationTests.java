@SpringBootTest
class TastyApplicationTests {

//	There is a robot on a 10x10 grid. It starts at the top left. Each square in the grid is one of 10 colors, except for one special square that has a star.
//
//	The robot can be programmed by giving it a lookup table from color to cardinal direction (N, S, E, W). It only understands programs of this type.
//
//	Given a grid, determine if there is a program that will navigate the robot from its starting point to the star. If so, output the program.
//
//	Details
//
//	The 10 colors in the grid are represented by the numbers 1, 2, ..., 10.
//	The star is represented by the number 0.
//	Your solution should be given by a function
//
//	LookupTable solve(Grid grid) { ... }
//
//	where Grid and LookupTable are wrapper classes for the input and output, respectively. How you decide to model these is up to you.
//
//	Return null if no solution exists.
